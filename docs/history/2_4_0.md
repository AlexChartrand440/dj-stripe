-   The field `djstripe_owner_account` has been added to all Stripe models, and is
    automatically populated with the Account that owns the API key used to retrieve it.
-   Support for subscription schedules (#899).

    InvoiceItems using Stripe's old IDs to the new ones.
-   Hundreds of other bugfixes.

## Major deprecations

Nobody likes features being removed. However, the last few releases we have had to
remove features that were not core to what dj-stripe does, or simply poorly-maintained.
To keep up with the trend, we are making three major deprecations this release:

### Creating Plans from the Django Admin is no longer supported

The `Plan` model was special cased in various places, including being the only one which
supported being created from the Django administration. This is no longer supported. We
have plans to allow creating arbitrary Stripe objects from the Django Admin, but until
it can be done consistently, we have decided to remove the feature for Plans (which are
deprecated by Stripe anyway). The only object type you should be dealing with from the
admin is the new APIKey model.

Along with this, we are also deprecating the `djstripe_sync_plans_from_stripe`
management command. You can instead use the `djstripe_sync_models` management command,
which supports arbitrary models.

### Deprecating the REST API

We are dropping all support for the REST API and will be fully removing it in 2.5.0.
We're doing this because we wish to keep such an API separate from dj-stripe. Work has
already started on a new project: https://github.com/dj-stripe/

### Deprecating `djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware`

Large parts of dj-stripe, including this middleware, were designed before Stripe's major
revamps of the old Plan model into Prices, Products, and multi-plan subscriptions. The
functionality offered by the middleware is no longer adequate, and building on top of it
would not be particularly robust. We may bring similar functionality back in the future,
but the middleware as it is is going away (as well as the undocumented
`djstripe.utils.subscriber_has_active_subscription` utility function).

If you want to keep the functionality for your project, you may wish to [copy the latest
version of the
middleware](https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/blob/2.4.0/djstripe/middleware.py).

### Deprecating `djstripe.mixins`

This is being deprecated for similar reasons as the SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware.
However, the mixins module was undocumented and never officially supported.

### Other deprecations

-   The `account` field on `Charge` has been renamed to `on_behalf_of`, to be consistent
    with Stripe's upstream model. Note that this field is separate from
    `djstripe_owner_account`, which is set by dj-stripe itself to match the account of
    the API key used.
-   `Account.get_connected_account_from_token()` is deprecated in favour of
    `Account.get_or_retrieve_for_api_key()`, which supports more than just Connect
    accounts.
-   `Customer.has_active_subscription()` is deprecated in favour of
    `Customer.is_subscribed_to()`. Note that the former takes a plan as argument,
    whereas the latter takes a product as argument.
-   The `tax_percent` attribute of `Invoice` is no longer populated and will be removed
    in 2.5.0. You may want to use `Invoice.default_tax_rates` instead, which uses the
    new TaxId functionality.
-   `Customer.business_vat_id` is being deprecated in favour of using TaxId models
    directly.

## Breaking changes

-   Rename PlanBillingScheme to BillingScheme.
-   Remove `Plan.update_name()` and these previously-deprecated fields:

    -   `Customer.business_vat_id`
    -   `Subscription.start`
    -   `Subscription.billing`

## Upgrade Guide

Before you upgrade to dj-stripe 2.4.0, we recommend upgrading to dj-stripe 2.3.0.
Upgrading one major release at a time minimizes the risk of issues arising.

Upgrading directly to 2.4.0 from dj-stripe versions older than 2.2.0 is unsupported.

To upgrade dj-stripe, run `pip install --upgrade dj-stripe==2.4.0`.

Once installed, you can run `manage.py migrate djstripe` to migrate the database models.

!!! note

    Migrating the database models may take a long time on databases with large amounts of customers.
