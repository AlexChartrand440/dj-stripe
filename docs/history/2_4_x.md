# dj-stripe 2.4.1 release notes (unreleased)

## Release notes

-   The `Price` model was incorrectly released with an `amount_in_cents` property,
    matching that of the `Plan` model. However, Price amounts are already in cent. The
    property has been removed, use `unit_amount` instead.
-   Fix `Price.human_readable_price` calculation
-   Fix non-blank nullable `Charge` fields
